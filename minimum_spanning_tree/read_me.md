# Graph Spanning Trees

## Project Overview

This project finds all spanning trees of a graph, including the minimum and maximum spanning trees. 
A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all vertices and is connected and acyclic.

## Key Features

- **All Spanning Trees:** Computes all possible spanning trees for a given graph.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Finds the spanning tree with the minimum total edge weight.
- **Maximum Spanning Tree:** Identifies the spanning tree with the maximum total edge weight.

## Algorithms

- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Used to find the minimum spanning tree.
